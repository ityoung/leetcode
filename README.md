question: ZigZag Conversion <br>[my answer](https://github.com/ityoung/leetcode//blob/master/Algorithms/ZigZagConversion.c "Time complexity: O(N)")<br><br>
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)<br>

P   A   H   N<br>
A P L S I I G<br>
Y   I   R<br>
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"<br>
Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:<br>

string convert(string text, int nRows);<br>
convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3) should return "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR".

question: Longest Palindromic Substring <br>[my answer](https://github.com/ityoung/leetcode//blob/master/Algorithms/LongestPalindromicSubstring.c "Manacher algorithm, Time complexity: O(N)")<br><br>
Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S. You may assume that the maximum length of S is 1000, and there exists one unique longest palindromic substring.

###a4
question: Median of Two Sorted Arrays <br>[my answer](https://github.com/ityoung/leetcode//blob/master/Algorithms/MedianofTwoSortedArrays.c "Time complexity: O(N)")<br><br>
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively. Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

###a3
question: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters  <br>
[`my answer`](https://github.com/ityoung/leetcode/blob/master/Algorithms/LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters.c "Time complexity: O(N^2);Space complexity: O(1)") and [leetcode answer](https://github.com/ityoung/leetcode/blob/master/Algorithms/T3-2.c "Time complexity: O(N);Space complexity: O(N)")<br><br>
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. For example, the longest substring without repeating letters for "abcabcbb" is "abc", which the length is 3. For "bbbbb" the longest substring is "b", with the length of 1.

###a2
question: Add Two Numbers  <br>[my answer](https://github.com/ityoung/leetcode/blob/master/Algorithms/AddTwoNumbers.c "Time complexity: O(max(m,n));Space complexity: O(max(m,n))")<br><br>
You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative numbers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

###a1
question: Two Sum  <br>[my answer](https://github.com/ityoung/leetcode/blob/master/Algorithms/TwoSum.c "Time complexity: O(N)")<br><br>
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.<br>
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.<br>
Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,<br>
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
