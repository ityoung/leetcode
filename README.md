#3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
(my answer(O(N^2)):https://github.com/ityoung/leetcode/blob/master/LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters.c)

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. For example, the longest substring without repeating letters for "abcabcbb" is "abc", which the length is 3. For "bbbbb" the longest substring is "b", with the length of 1.

#2. Add Two Numbers
(my answer:https://github.com/ityoung/leetcode/blob/master/AddTwoNumbers.c)

You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative numbers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

#1. Two Sum
(my answer:https://github.com/ityoung/leetcode/blob/master/TwoSum.c)

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
